# Research Plan for VAOS Community Care Discovery, October 2020 [DRAFT]

*Problem:* As a veteran, I would like the VAOS app to automatically find community care providers closest to my residential address and auto populate the providers I've selected into the VAOS provider fields so I don't have to manually enter or copy-paste this information.

## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
This research is for the VA Online Scheduling (VAOS) team.

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	
VAOS allows veterans to schedule health care appointments at VAMCs, or with providers in their community if the veteran meets certain eligibility requirements. 

Community care appointments allow veterans to receive care from providers in their area. Community care appointments have grown significantly since it was We want to learn how best to communicate the difference between community care and VA appointments to veterans. We also want to learn about the ways veterans prefer to choose providers.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?

[Note: we're still narrowing this list down - PR]

* What is the clearest way to explain community care to a veteran scheduling a cc appointment for the first time?
* How do veterans prefer to choose a community care provider? We'll test [narrow these down]:
  * Search for a specific provider
  * Let the scheduler choose provider based on distance from their location or prefereed address
  * Select up to three providers and let the VA scheduler make the final choice
  * Ask them to rank provider choices
  * Skip the selection process entirely and let the VA choose a provider for them?
* In what ways do veterans want to schedule a new appointment with a provider they've previously seen?
  * Start with the provider already selected, then fill out everything else?
  * Make recurring appointments with that provider?
  * Get reminders to schedule annual appointments?

We may also test usability for features unrelated to community care:
* Do veterans know how to find their scheduled appointments on the home page?
* Do the new descriptions under the type of care options help veterans find the type of care they need?


4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 
* Veterans will want to be able to return to the same provider repeatedly.
* Veterans will be able to request a community care appointment.

	
## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
This is a remote moderated usability study, via Zoom
  		
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?
By asking veterans to talk about their needs around community care and provider selection, we hope to learn how their mental model about this service differs from what we've presented. We believe asking them to interact with a conceptual prototype is the fastest way to understand their needs.

3.	What will you be testing? 
A concept prototype in InVision.
	
## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	

* 5-8 veterans
* Generally matching the typical demographic breakdown of veterans
* Familiarity with community care is not required

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-
1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.) 

TBD

2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

*Pro tips for writing recruiting critera:* 
- If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
- Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc. 

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract - Perigean - or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact Research Contract Lead.)	

We will ask Perigean to recruit veterans for this study.

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.)

TBD

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

TBD

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

< 1 hour

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.

TBD

5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?

TBD

## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker**
